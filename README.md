## ðŸ”§ Recent Enhancements (Latest Update)

This version introduces significant upgrades to make the agent a more powerful and versatile financial analyst.

### 1. **New Tool: Comprehensive Stock Details (`get_complete_stock_details`)**
A new, powerful function has been added to perform a deep-dive analysis on any single stock. When you ask for a full report (e.g., "Tell me everything about RELIANCE.NS"), the agent now provides:
-   **Basic Info:** Sector, industry, CEO.
-   **Valuation:** P/E, PEG, P/B ratios.
-   **Profitability & Growth:** Profit margins, RoE, revenue growth.
-   **Financial Health:** Debt-to-equity, current ratio.
-   **Technical Indicators:** Key SMAs, EMAs, and RSI.
-   **Analyst Ratings:** Target price and recommendations.

### 2. **Enhanced AI System Instructions**
The core `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` for the Gemini model has been overhauled for superior performance:
-   **Smarter Tool Selection:** The AI now has clearer rules for choosing the right tool for the job.
-   **Tool Combination:** The agent is explicitly instructed to **combine multiple tools** to formulate a single, comprehensive answer. For example, it will automatically fetch financials and news for any stock it recommends.
-   **Advanced Analytical Capabilities:** The agent is now empowered to answer more complex follow-up questions (e.g., "What's a good target price?" or "Suggest a stop-loss") by synthesizing data from its tools.
